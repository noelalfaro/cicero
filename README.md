# Cicero — Prospect Portfolio

A pseudo NBA investment platform where users invest in players rated by a **PR Score** — a composite of in-game stats and social media sentiment analysis.

This repo is **Courtside**, the Next.js frontend. The Python backend (Combine) lives in [cicero-scripts](../nba-python/cicero/cicero-scripts).

## Local Setup

**1. Clone and install**

```bash
git clone <repo-url>
cd cicero
npm install
```

**2. Set up environment variables**

Copy the example below into `.env.local` and fill in your values:

```bash
# Better Auth
BETTER_AUTH_SECRET=
BETTER_AUTH_URL=http://localhost:3000

# Google OAuth
GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID=
GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET=

# Database
DRIZZLE_DATABASE_URL=

# Uploadthing
UPLOADTHING_TOKEN=
```

**3. Push the database schema**

```bash
npm run db:push
```

**4. Start the dev server**

```bash
npm run dev
```

App runs at `http://localhost:3000`.

## Project Structure

```
app/
  (main)/         # Authenticated routes (dashboard, players, users)
  (public)/       # Public routes (login, landing)
  onboarding/     # Onboarding flow (runs after first login)
  api/            # API routes (auth, users, uploadthing)
components/       # Shared UI components
lib/              # Auth config, data fetching, type definitions
server/
  db/             # Drizzle schema + client
middleware.ts     # Auth + onboarding redirect logic
```

---

## Auth Flow

1. User clicks "Sign in with Google" → Better Auth initiates OAuth flow
2. Google redirects back → Better Auth creates `users` row with `onboarding_status=false`
3. Middleware checks session + onboarding status:
   - No session → redirect to `/login`
   - Session but not onboarded → redirect to `/onboarding`
   - Onboarded → allow access to protected routes
4. Onboarding form POSTs to `/api/users/complete-onboarding` → flips `onboarding_status=true`

## Branching and staging workflow

**Branches:**
- `main` — production, always stable
- `staging` — permanent beta environment for live testing before merging to main. Never merges into main.
- `crt-XX-short-description` — feature branches, always off latest `main`

**Starting a ticket:**
```bash
git checkout main && git pull
git checkout -b crt-XX-short-description
```

**Before merging a PR — test on staging:**
```bash
git checkout staging && git pull
git merge crt-XX-short-description
git push                          # triggers Vercel staging deploy
# verify on staging URL, then merge PR → main
```

**After merging to main — reset staging:**
```bash
git checkout staging
git reset --hard main
git push --force                  # staging is now a clean mirror of main
```
